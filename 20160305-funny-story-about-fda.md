I was just recalling a funny incident during an FDA audit at SIEMENS Oncology. I met with the inspectors the first week of the audit, and during the course of that meeting the lead inspector (I think her name was Kim) gave me a post-it note with her mobile number on it.

My boss was sitting next to me, and after the meeting he said "Maybe she wants to go out with you!".  

Over the next several weeks, the audit turned in to quite a blood bath.  True Story!
