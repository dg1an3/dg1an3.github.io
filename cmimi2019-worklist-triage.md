Radiotherapy Image Review Worklist Triage
-----------------
At C-MIMI in Austin this year, one of the talks that caught my attention was on a system called DeepCAT, which is a worklist triage system for mammogram screening.  It used deep learning to prioritize mammograms, as well as filtering out low risk images.

It seems that a similar approach would benefit RT image review.  Experience with Mosaiq image review users indicates a benefit from anything that can streamline the workflow.  A triage model would predict:
* Which images are most likely to need more intensive review?
* Which are least likely to result in any adjustment?

This information could be used to:
* Prioritize the user‘s worklist
* Pre-cache images based on review priority
* Prime an adaptive streaming capability

I‘ve created a simple prototype QA worklist, using the rotation model predictions generated by the SRO decoder ring.  It prioritizes a list of synthetic images based on the SRO decoder loss function (in this case, categorical cross entropy).

This same concept could be applied to a clinical image review worklist, but trained with site-specific metric(s).  The latent space of patient geometries could be valuable in defining such metrics.
